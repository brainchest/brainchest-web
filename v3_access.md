title:  "Time Stamp v3 Beta Access"
---
Time Stamp v3 Beta is now available for testing. It contains a lot of new features. Apart from that, about 90% of the internal code was rewritten to allow for future releases on other platforms like Windows 10, iOS and Android. This is also the main reason that development of v3 took more than one year.

Here is the list of new features:

* Export the Excel report to Google Drive, DropBox, Excel on WP, E-Mail
* Save the Backup on Google Drive, DropBox, or send via E-Mail
* Settings completely reorganized
* New themes
* GPS based start/end of work units
* New year-based overview in the report
* Transparent Tiles
* Round start/end times
* Tags can be managed separately of work units
* Setup wizard to help with a first-time setup
* Tons of minor UI tweaks

**Phone Requirements:** Please note that the Beta currently is only available for Windows Phone 8.1. I will start working on a native Windows 10 version in parallel and will start with the Beta as soon as possible. However, this Beta program will be different from the WP8.1 one. More info on that later. Please my Twitter/Facebook account for more info on that.

**So how to get access to the Beta now?** Time Stamp v3 Beta is a separate app download in the store. You only get access to that if I add your E-Mail address to a white list. So you won't find it when searching the store. This in turn means that you will have two versions on your phone. The current v2.4.2 and v3.0.x. As soon as v3 is final I will update v2.4.2 to the latest version. This has the advantage that the new functions can be tested before it is made globally available. So if you want to get access to the Beta please send me (<mailto:stephan@brainchest.net>) an E-Mail that contains the following information.

* Name
* E-Mail address that you used to register your Windows Phone
* Do you want to see Time Stamp in your native language? If yes, are you interested in helping out?
* Your agreement: Please do not give negative ratings for the generally available version v2.4.2 based on your experience with v3. v3 is in Beta so will very likely still have issues that need to be fixed.

Some further frequently asked questions (FAQ)

#### When will the final version of Time Stamp v3 be available?

Short answer: When it's ready. Probably some time in 2016.

#### Does the Beta have Bugs?

Allthough I tested Time Stamp a lot and have >200 Unit Tests (increasing), it certainly has. After all it is a Beta :) 

#### Why is it not available on Windows 10 (Phone) yet?

I will create a native version of the UI that will use the same core. I don't want to support that currently due to a limited amount of time.

#### I have more questions!

Then just send me an E-Mail (<mailto:stephan@brainchest.net>)
