                    <li class="no-chapter">A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web
                        browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests
                        a page from the server.</li>
                    <li class="no-chapter">Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser
                        and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session
                        cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.</li>
                    <li class="no-chapter">Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that
